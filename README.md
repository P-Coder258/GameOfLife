# Game of Life Simulator

A Python implementation of Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automaton that simulates the life and death of cells on a grid. This project provides a simple yet powerful tool for exploring the dynamics of cellular automata, with features such as customizable rules and visualization.

## Features
- Implementation of the classic Conway's Game of Life rules.
- Support for custom initial patterns and grid sizes.
- Visualization of the simulation in the terminal.
- Extendable framework for adding custom rules or visualization methods.
